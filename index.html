    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      As an End-of-Life Doula, I play a vital role in providing comfort, guidance, and companionship to individuals and families who are facing the end of life. I work closely with families to understand their needs, values, and beliefs, providing holistic support that encompasses emotional, spiritual, and practical guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to ensure that the dying person and their loved ones feel supported, heard, and empowered during this challenging time. I provide education and resources to help families navigate the dying process, make informed decisions about end-of-life care, and offer support and guidance during the bereavement process. My extensive training, along with my full-time presence and companionship during vigil and at death, my advocacy, and support for physical, practical, and life review needs, represent a service not widely offered elsewhere.

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "I have witnessed Jennifer's compassionate listening skills as she lovingly attends to our community. She is able to thoughtfully listen and engage the entire spectrum of age. The youngest kiddos adore her, the elders among us love and respect her; and the young adults/college kids confide in her. Her nonjudgemental ear offers a safe place for even the saddest of hearts. Jennifer is the ideal companion when anyone is walking through the valley of the shadow of death."

    <blockquote>
      "You have a very specific skill that you bring to the situation... It's a big weight off my shoulders to know that there's someone else there to be double checking and keeping an eye on things at the hospital and with the hospice nurses at home, it's priceless really. And of course, the time spent with Dad, which he really enjoyed."

    <blockquote>
      "I hope we never need you, but if we did, I would choose you."

    <blockquote>
      "Recently my father became very ill with lung cancer. Jennifer went and spent time with him when I couldn't. He enjoyed her company. When he was taken to the hospital, she followed him there. Her presence at the hospital was so welcomed because she was able to advocate for my dad when we didn't know what to say or how to say it. Jennifer was there with us shortly after my dad passed. She was there to comfort us and help us with making arrangements."
